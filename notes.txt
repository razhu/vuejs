1. event bus to transmit data between child components
2. to have style for a particular component, use 'scoped'
- <slot> is used to pass blocks of html o just ext
NOTE about slots: the styling is set in the child component, everthing else is handled in the parten component
slots props could be used to pass individual content
- in dyamic componentes, they are destroy as you navigate but it can be kept alive
with <keep-alive>
-there are two life cycles we can use to monitor keeping alive a component:
they are: activated, and deactivated

//FORMS
- input modifiers ej
v.model.lazy.number
this will only reflect once we click on somewhere else and will convert it to a number
v.model.lazy.trim
this will remove white or empy spaces before and or after a text

<textarea>{{text}}<textarea> no, it does not wokr
<textarea v-model="aText"><textarea> this works to have a default or placeholder

-output with line breas
<p style="white-space: pre">{{message}}</p>

-when using checkboxes, use just one array. Vue js will add the values of the check ones

- radio button. values of radio buttons attached to the same model. vuejs will hld the value of the elected one 

-for dropdown menus, pu the model under <select> tag, not under <options>

///////directives : v-something
A directive has 5 life cycles: bind, inserted, update, componentUpdated, unbind

/////filters and mixins
filter: transfor output in the data. They always expect a value as input
note vuejs doesnt ship with built-in filters
they could be registed both globally and locally
they are reprsented as something like 
{{ algo | filter}}


///NOTEEEE
computed:{
    //they are always functions, methods with return
}
//mixins: code or data to be shared among multiple compnents
mixins are mered with data etc in a vue instance 
but what is the component overrides a mixin data
Note: mixins data are not shared, but copied to callers

note. prefer computed over filters

////ANIMATIONS
//transitions: appliced to only one instance or elemnt
        <transition>
    requirements: el needs to be under transition tag and have a if or show conditional
-enter
-enter-activate
-leave
-leave-active
have a look at https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/
till this point we used css hooks to animate.
we can also use js of course to animate...

////transition group, somethign lke this
<transition-group>
    <li></li> //no ul!
</transition-group>

///HTTP
vue resource
use firebase for testing purposes

when setting url as global, you use
Vue.http...
note there is not $ (dollar sign). you only use $ with a component

///interceptors .eg you can override methods. POST for PUT for instace..

//resoures... write resource 'replace' this.$http.post.. etc etc
$http vs resources... you are better off with $http..
....go read  vue resources docus

////////Router. this is key for SPAs
1. install vue-Router
2. regiser routes. youcan do so in a file named router.js. there import components and the create routes, like path .. etc compponent etc
